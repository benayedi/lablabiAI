## Project: Solving the Knowron Challenge

### Technology Stack
- *Language*: Python
- *Frontend*: Streamlit
- *Image Dense Captioning*: Azure Computer Vision API
- *Speech-to-Text & Translation*: Azure Cognitive Services
- *Information Extraction*: Cohere's Natural Language Generator AI
- *Report Generation*: ReportLab

### Implementation Steps

1. *Frontend*
   - Implement the user interface using Streamlit for rapid prototyping and easy deployment
   - Allow users to input text, voice memos, and images

2. *Image Dense Captioning*
   - Use Azure Computer Vision API for extracting dense captions from images
   - Process the captions and prepare them for integration into the final report

3. *Speech-to-Text & Translation*
   - Convert voice memos into text using Azure Speech-to-Text
   - Translate the extracted text and user-entered text into English using Azure Translator

4. *Information Extraction*
   - Use Cohere's Natural Language Generator AI for information extraction
   - Fill a general task report template with the extracted information

5. *Report Generation*
   - Generate the final report as a PDF document
   - Ensure the report has sections and clear descriptions in English.
